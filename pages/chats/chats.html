          Hello All: I do understand that some of the videos do link up. The
          solution is to go to youtube and enter in the topic/title and find a
          reasonable replacement, for example:
          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L6IQcqwkek
          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i85SXP0QwA8 The goal is to complete
          the activity sheets in order to attain an understanding of the French
          Revolution so you will have the historical evidence when you
          eventually do the comparison of the American and French Revolutions.
          Take care, Kevin
